This game is a work in progress and as you can see, I have been experimenting with how to make this page functional. I got the inspiration for the project a few weeks ago and thought back to my youth about how neat these books were. There will be many edits down the road to include the actual story, consolidating the code, and page formatting. Technologies used to make this are HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
